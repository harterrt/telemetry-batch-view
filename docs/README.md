# README

This directory contains the following documentation for each dataset:

* Example commands to generate data
* Dataset Schemas

End user documentation for these datasets is kept in the reference section of the
[Firefox Data Docs](https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-data-docs/).
For example, here's the
[longitudinal documentation](https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-data-docs/datasets/batch_view/longitudinal/reference.html)

If you're trying to decide what dataset to use for an analysis,
take a look at [Choosing a Dataset](https://mozilla.github.io/firefox-data-docs/concepts/choosing_a_dataset.html)
